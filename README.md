  <h2>About Kex</h2>
  <p>Welcome. I'm PDX, the founder of Kex—a collective of developers with a hacker's edge. We specialize in crafting HTML code that’s powerful, adaptable, and just a little bit dangerous. Our work is designed to push boundaries, creating tools and frameworks that are versatile enough for any project, yet capable of something more... subversive.</p>
