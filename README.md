  <h2>About Kex</h2>
  <p>Welcome. I'm PDX, the founder of Kex—a collective of developers with a hacker's edge. We specialize in crafting HTML code that’s powerful, adaptable, and just a little bit dangerous. Our work is designed to push boundaries, creating tools and frameworks that are versatile enough for any project, yet capable of something more... subversive.</p>
  <p>Kex is about more than just coding; it's about rethinking how we interact with the digital world. We're focused on building projects that aren’t just functional, but also have the potential to disrupt. Whether you're developing something mainstream or something that operates in the shadows, our code is built to meet your needs.</p>
  <p>Dive into our repository and see what Kex can do. We're not here to follow the rules—we're here
